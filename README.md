# Data Structures

- This repository represents my work at Data Structures course on university.
- Laboratory's homework are implemented in C++.
* At this course I've learned about simple and advanced data structures like:
    1. Vectors and matrices
    2. Stacks and queues
    3. Heaps and binary trees
    4. Search binary trees (Red-Black and AVL trees)
    5. B-trees
    6. Hash tables
    7. Quad trees

- Moreover, I've implemented a manual symmetric encryption cipher called Playfair Cipher as an extra homework.
