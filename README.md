# Data Structures

- This repository represents my work at Data Structures course at university.
- Laboratory topics are implemented in C++.
* At this course I've learned about simple and advanced data structures like:
1. Vectors and matrices
1. Stacks and queues
1. Heaps and binary trees
1. Search binary trees (Red-Black and AVL trees)
1. B-trees
1. Hash tables
1. Quad trees

- Moreover, I've implemented a manual symmetric encryption cipher called Playfair Cipher as an extra homework.
