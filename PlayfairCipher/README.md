# Playfair Cipher

- The implementation of this encryption method was an extra homework at the university that I did.
- The implementation is made in C++.
- The Playfair Cipher is a manual symmetric encryption cipher invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone, however itâ€™s name and popularity came from the endorsement of Lord Playfair.
- I had used as documentation for this project <a href="https://privacycanada.net/classical-encryption/playfair-cipher/"> this website</a>.
